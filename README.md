# PrimeNumbers
Project contains two console applications for generating primes and fibonacci sequences. Application use Unity container and dependency injection to resolve dependencies.

Primes console application.
1.  Input variable - User input number which represent starting point to generate next 10 primes. Input number don’t have to be prime number. If negative numbers will be entered than this number will be ignored and starting number will be 0.
2.	Program behaviour – After generating 10 prime numbers, engine format them to two dimensional array and next it change array to string which is displayed in for of grid.

Fibonacci console application.
1.  Input variable - User input number which represent lenght of fibbonacci sequence to generate. If negative numbers will be entered than this number will be ignored and starting number will be 0.
2.	Program behaviour – After generating fibonacci sequence, engine format it to two dimensional array and next it change array to string which is displayed in for of grid.
